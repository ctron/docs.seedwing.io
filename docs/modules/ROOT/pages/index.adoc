`Seedwing-Policy` is a type/pattern/function-based _policy engine_ which can be embedded in another process, or accessed over REST APIs. The general idea of a policy engine is that a consumer requiring a decision presents the information they have available, and the policy engine inspects the information, possibly transforming or augmenting it, to provide a decision as to if the inputs represent compliance or violation of the policy.

Seedwing Policy consists of components that may be combined or used standalone:

* *Dogma* - a policy language.
* *Engine* - a policy evaluation engine.
